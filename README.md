# USB HID phone runtime code for Arduino

Allow controlling online meeting's "mute" button with a custom USB HID device.

Requirements:

- [ReSpeaker Arduino Library](https://github.com/respeaker/respeaker_arduino_library)
- [Arduino HID Project - fork](https://github.com/imrehg/HID/) (the `phone` branch)

Flash this project on your device, and plug it into your computer to control online
meetings like Google Meet. You might need to pair the device for the first time.
